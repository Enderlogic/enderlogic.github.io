I'm a postdoc at Hong Kong Baptist University, supervised by Dr. <a href=https://bhanml.github.io/group.html>Bo Han</a> and Dr. <a href=https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/v1/?page=profile&id=ericluzhang> Lu Zhang</a>. Before I joined HKBU, I got my PhD from Queen Mary, University of London, supervised by Dr. <a href='http://constantinou.info'>Anthony C. Constantinou</a>. My research interests mainly cover causal discovery, noisy data and explainable AI. I obtained my master and bachelor degree from the University of Edinburgh and Beihang University respectively. Below are some of the papers I published during my PhD.
