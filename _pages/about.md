I'm a PhD student in Machine Intelligence and Decision Systems (<a href='https://minds.qmul.ac.uk'>MInDS</a>) Research Group in Queen Mary, University of London. My supervisor is <a href='http://constantinou.info'>Anthony C. Constantinou</a>. My current research interests cover causal discovery under the noisy data and explainable AI. I obtained my master and bachelor degree from the University of Edinburgh and Beihang University respectively. Below are some of the papers published during my PhD life.
